# Stock Market Trend Prediction using AI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Minor in AI – IIT Ropar (Module E)**.  
It focuses on analyzing **stock market trends** using deep learning models such as **LSTM** and **GRU**.  
The aim is to predict future stock prices based on historical time-series data and evaluate performance using standard metrics.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of stock price data (scaling, windowing).  
- Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) for sequential prediction.  
- Evaluation using RMSE & MAPE.  
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices.  
- End-to-end workflow in a clean, reproducible notebook.

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage
1. Open `notebooks/final.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or Jupyter.  
2. Upload your dataset (e.g., Yahoo Finance stock data in CSV).  
3. Run all cells to preprocess, train, evaluate, and visualize predictions.

## 📊 Results
- **RMSE:** ~XX.XX  
- **MAPE:** ~XX.X%  
- LSTM/GRU models outperform simple baselines.  
- Visualization shows predicted vs actual trends.  

*(Replace XX with your final results)*
